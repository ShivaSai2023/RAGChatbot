SUMMARY
Experienced Software Engineer with 3+ years in automation, system maintenance, and troubleshooting. I am skilled in building and managing
IoT-enabled systems and resolving issues across web hosting, DNS, and email. Proficient in real-time data processing, API development, and
backend performance tuning. Strong programming in Python, Bash, C++, and SQL with solid Linux OS expertise. Familiar with SLIs, SLOs, and
maintaining error budgets for reliable system operations.
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Software Engineer, G-Think Inventors | Hyderabad, India Oct ‘20 – July ‘23
G-Think Inventors is a Home Automation start-up which develops products to control the electrical appliances using a mobile application. As
a Software Engineer, I got an opportunity to collaborate with multiple teams directly and gather the requirements for developing exciting
projects. Below are my key responsibilities.
● Built and maintained RESTful APIs using Django framework in an MVC architecture, writing clean and reliable Python code. Tested
endpoints with Postman and created documentation to help other teams integrate smoothly.
● Troubleshot and resolved real-time issues like bugs and connectivity problems, using Python and network tools. Also managed Overthe-Air (OTA) firmware and software updates for remote IoT devices, ensuring smooth rollouts through CI/CD pipelines with GitHub
Actions.
● Collaborated with hardware and data engineering teams to ensure reliable communication between IoT devices and PostgreSQL
database using JSON and REST APIs. Also automated system diagnostics and alerts with Python, shell scripts, and AWS CloudWatch,
this improved incident detection and reduced support tickets by 60%.
● Maintained detailed documentation for configurations, updates, and troubleshooting to support long-term system maintenance.
Also improved performance in resource-constrained IoT environments by profiling and optimizing code and memory usage.
Software Engineer Intern, G-Think Inventors | Hyderabad, India June ‘19 - Oct ‘19
As an intern I worked on automated system to generate a power utilization report which is used by households to see the energy utilized by
individual appliance and take required action if any appliance is consuming high energy, for efficient utilization of electricity. My
responsibility in this project is as follows.
● Designed efficient data storage structures for smooth processing and used Python tools like NumPy and Pandas to clean and
preprocess sensor data, ensuring reliable and accurate results.
● Built an automated reporting tool using Matplotlib to visualize energy usage by appliance, automated process using bash script to
run once a month for all the households to provide them with monthly energy utilization report, it is users to identify high energy
consumption devices and make informed decisions to save energy. It helped households to save 20% of energy.
PROJECTS
Remote Monitoring and Control System | Java, C++, IoT Aug ‘19
● Developed using Java and C++ programming for IoT based car controlled with Android application with live video streaming from
anywhere within the network. Used MQTT protocol to transfer moving commands from application to Arduino robot car and HTTP
protocol to transfer live video streaming from robot car to application.
Self-Navigating Robotic Vacuum Cleaner | Python, Raspberry Pi May ‘20
● Designed and developed a self-navigating robotic vacuum cleaner using Python on a Raspberry Pi on Linux operating system.
Integrated IoT sensors to enable real-time environmental scanning and responsive cleaning actions. Achieved significant
improvements in both cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency compared to conventional models.
